## Summary

`ButtonRow` should be used to display two `Buttons` side-by-side. The `ButtonRow` should fill the readable content width of the screen, and its distribution should be used to define the layout of the buttons within it.

### Distribution

A `ButtonRow`â€™s distribution determines both the size and position of its buttons. `ButtonRow.Distribution` is an enum with three cases:

#### Equal

Left & right buttons each use 50% of the total space.

#### Emphasis

Left button is given enough space to fit its content, and right button takes up the remaining space.

#### Minimal

Left & right buttons are each given enough space to fit their content, but with the additional restriction that the right button never be smaller than the left button.
