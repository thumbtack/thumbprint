![CalendarPicker](/img/ios/calendar.png 'Calendar Picker')

The CalendarPicker can be used to both display availability information (by marking dates with a dot or a slash mark), and solicit date selection(s) from the user. It can be configured to display any possible date range, and can be made interactive by registering for its delegate callback methods.

### Scrollable Range

By default, the CalendarPicker component can scroll infinitely far into the past and future. In situations where such a wide range does not make sense (e.g., selecting birthdays or scheduling future appointments), the range can be limited by specifying the number of future/past months that the user should be allowed to scroll to. Furthermore, the calendar can be preconfigured to display a particular month/year.

![CalendarPicker - Future only](/img/ios/calendar_no_previous.png 'CalendarPicker - Future only')

```swift
calendarPicker.goToDate(date: december2020, animated: false)
calendarPicker.previousMonthCount = 0

```

![CalendarPicker - Past Only](/img/ios/calendar_no_next.png 'CalendarPicker - Past Only')

```swift
calendarPicker.goToDate(date: december2020, animated: false)
calendarPicker.additionalMonthCount = 0

```

### Enabling/Disabling Selection

![CalendarPicker - Date selected](/img/ios/calendar_date_selected.png 'CalendarPicker - Date selected')

CalendarPicker supports both singular and multiple selection of calendar dates. Selected dates are stored internally, and persisted when the user scrolls between months. Date interaction notifications are sent to the CalendarPicker's delegate.

```swift
calendarPicker.allowsSelection = true // Default is true
calendarPicker.allowsMultipleSelection = false // Default is false

```

![CalendarPicker - Multiple Selection](/img/ios/calendar_multiple_selection.png 'CalendarPicker - Multiple Selection')

In addition to being notified when the user interacts with the calendar's selected dates, the developer may query or set the calendar's selected dates directly.

```swift
calendarPicker.selectedDates = [dec2, dec11, dec23]
print(calendarPicker.selectedDates.map({ dateFormatter.string(from: $0) }))

```

### Date Marks

![CalendarPicker - Date marks](/img/ios/calendar_slashes_dots.png 'CalendarPicker - Date marks')

Date cells can be assigned slash or dot marks by implementing the delegate callback methods:

```swift
CalendarPicker(_ CalendarPicker: CalendarPicker, cellHasDotForDate date: Date) -> Bool
CalendarPicker(_ CalendarPicker: CalendarPicker, cellHasSlashForDate date: Date) -> Bool
```

### Configuring the Calendar Height Modes

![CalendarPicker - Height modes](/img/ios/calendar_height_modes.png 'CalendarPicker - Height Modes')

CalendarPickers internally manage their own height – *they should never have a height constraint imposed upon them*.

The CalendarPicker supports two height modes: `Fixed` and `Dynamic`. A fixed height CalendarPicker will always show the maximum number of rows that can displayed for a given calendar, even if the current month requires fewer rows. For a Gregorian calendar, the maximum number of rows a month can need is six.

If the `calendarHeightMode` is set to `dynamic`, then the calendar will expand and collapse as as necessary to display the minimum number of rows possible for each month. After transitioning to a new month, a `dynamic` height CalendarPicker will update its own internal height constraint and notify its delegates of the update.

```swift
calendarPicker.calendarHeightMode = .fixed
calendarPicker.calendarHeightMode = .dynamic // Default
```

### Configuring the Cell Height Modes

CalendarPicker cells also have configurable heights, either `fixed` or `aspectRatio`. `Fixed` height cells are configured with a set constant height that they will conform to regardless CalendarPicker's width. In contrast, a cell with an `aspectRatio` height is configured with a fixed aspect ratio, which the CalendarPicker uses (along with its own width) to compute each cell's height.

![CalendarPicker - Fixed height cells](/img/ios/calendar_cell_fixed.png 'CalendarPicker - Fixed height cells')

```swift
calendarPicker.cellHeightMode = .fixed(70)
```

![CalendarPicker - Aspect ratio cells](/img/ios/calendar_cell_aspect.png 'CalendarPicker - Aspect ratio cells')

```swift
calendarPicker.cellHeightMode = .aspectRatio(1)  // Default
```

### Calendar Content Insets

When a user swipes between the months of a CalendarPicker, the cells can only remain visible while they are inside of the CalendarPicker's frame (at which point they will clip). To make the cells visibly scroll all the way to the edge of the parent view, you can use the CalendarPicker's `contentInset` instead. Adjusting the contentInset will push the visible grid inward from the frame's edges in the same way that insetting the frame would.

The following image shows two otherwise visually identical calendars in the middle of a scroll between months. Here, the calendar on the left has a full width frame but it's left and right contentInset is set to 16px. The calendar on the right has a frame that has been inset 16px from its parent. Notice that, in the image on the right, the date cells clip out of frame before they reach the edge of the screen.

Note: Top and bottom frame insets are unaffected by month to month scrolling.

![CalendarPicker - Insets](/img/ios/calendar_content_insets.png 'CalendarPicker - Insets')

```swift
// LEFT (Default)
calendarPicker.contentInsets = UIEdgeInsets(top: 12, left: 16, bottom: 12, right: 16)
calendarPicker.snp.makeConstraints { make in
    make.width.equalToSuperview()
}

```

```swift
// RIGHT
calendarPicker.contentInsets = .zero
calendarPicker.snp.makeConstraints { make in
	make.leading.trailing.equalToSuperview().inset(16)
    make.top.bottom.equalToSuperview.inset(12)
}

```

### CalendarPicker Header

The CalendarPicker's header (month, year, and month arrows) can be hidden to just display the grid of dates.

![CalendarPicker - No header](/img/ios/calendar_no_header.png 'CalendarPicker - No header')

```swift
// RIGHT
calendarPicker.hideHeader = true
```

## Delegate Callbacks

CalendarPicker supports the following delegate callback methods

-   `@objc optional func CalendarPickerHeightDidChange(_ CalendarPicker: CalendarPicker)`<br /> Called when a dynamic height calendar scrolls to a month with a different number of weeks

-   `@objc optional func CalendarPicker(_ CalendarPicker: CalendarPicker, didShowMonth month: Int, year: Int)`<br /> Called immediately after a calendar scrolls to a new month, before any height adjustments occur

-   `@objc optional func CalendarPicker(_ CalendarPicker: CalendarPicker, cellIsEnabledForDate date: Date) -> Bool`<br /> Return false to disable the cell for the given date

-   `@objc optional func CalendarPicker(_ CalendarPicker: CalendarPicker, cellHasDotForDate date: Date) -> Bool`<br /> Return true to add a dot to the cell with the given date

-   `@objc optional func CalendarPicker(_ CalendarPicker: CalendarPicker, cellHasSlashForDate date: Date) -> Bool`<br /> Return true to add a slash to the cell with the given date

-   `@objc optional func CalendarPicker(_ CalendarPicker: CalendarPicker, shouldSelectDate date: Date) -> Bool`<br /> Implement this method and return false to prevent selection of the given date

-   `@objc optional func CalendarPicker(_ CalendarPicker: CalendarPicker, shouldDeselectDate date: Date) -> Bool`<br /> Implement this method and return false to prevent deselection of the given date

-   `@objc optional func CalendarPicker(_ CalendarPicker: CalendarPicker, didSelectDate date: Date)`<br /> Called in response to a date being selected

-   `@objc optional func CalendarPicker(_ CalendarPicker: CalendarPicker, didDeselectDate date: Date)`<br /> Called in response to a date being deselected
