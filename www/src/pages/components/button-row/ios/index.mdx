## Summary

`ButtonRow` should be used to display two `Buttons` side-by-side. The `ButtonRow` should fill the readable content width of the screen, and its distribution should be used to define the layout of the buttons within it.

### Distribution

A `ButtonRow`â€™s distribution determines both the size and position of its buttons. `ButtonRow.Distribution` is an enum with three cases:

#### Equal

Left & right buttons each use 50% of the total space.

#### Emphasis

Left button is given enough space to fit its content, and right button takes up the remaining space.

#### Minimal

Left & right buttons are each given enough space to fit their content, but with the additional restriction that the right button never be smaller than the left button.

## Public API

#### `public init(leftButton: Button, rightButton: Button, distribution: Button.Distribution = .emphasis)`

Creates and returns a new button row with the specified buttons and distribution.

#### `public let leftButton: Button`

Button to be shown on the left, should typically have either a secondary or tertiary button style.

#### `public let rightButton: Button`

Button to be shown on the right, should typically have primary button style.

#### `public var distribution: Button.Distribution`

Enum specifying how the buttons should be distributed along the horizontal axis.

        # Get links to by path to display in the navbar.
        platformNav: allSitePage(filter: { path: { glob: "/components/button-row/*/" } }) {
            edges {
                node {
                    ...PlatformNavFragment
                }
            }
