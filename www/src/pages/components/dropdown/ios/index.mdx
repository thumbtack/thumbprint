Dropdowns allow a user to make a selection from a predefined set of options. When presented on the screen, only the selected option (or a placeholder) is visible. When the dropbox is tapped, a UIPickerView is presented from the bottom of the user's screen, allowing them to scroll through all of the available options.

## Options

Any text can be set as a dropbox option, though long strings will truncate to fit a single line in the pickerView. Therefore, option titles should be as brief as is practicable.

```swift
let dropbox = Dropbox(optionTitles: ["Thing 1", "Thing 2"])

```

## Placeholders

Dropdowns can be initialized with a placeholder string. The placeholder text is visible before the user has made any selection, but is not a selectable option in the pickerview, and thus can never be reselected by the user. The default placeholder text is "Choose one...", but it can be set to a more descriptive value.

```swift
dropbox.placeholder = "Pick a thing"
```

## States

Dropdowns support the following four states: default, highlighted, error, disabled.

#### Default

A dropbox in it's normal state.

![Default dropdown](/img/ios/dropdown.png 'Default dropdown')

```swift
dropbox.isEnabled = true
dropbox.hasError = false
dropbox.isHighlighted = false
```

#### Highlighted

The active dropbox with which the user is interacting. A dropbox will enter this state when tapped.

![Highlighted dropdown](/img/ios/dropdown_highlighed.png 'Highlighted dropdown')

```swift
dropbox.isEnabled = true
dropbox.hasError = false
dropbox.isHighlighted = true
```

#### Error

A dropbox that is failing some validation and needs a users attention.

![Error dropdown](/img/ios/dropdown_error.png 'Error dropdown')

```swift
dropbox.isEnabled = true
dropbox.hasError = true
```

### Disabled

A dropdown that cannot be selected by the user. This may be the case when the dropbox only applies to a path other than the one that the user has chosen.

![Disabled dropdown](/img/ios/dropdown_disabled.png 'Disabled Dropdown')

```swift
dropbox.isEnabled = false
```

export const pageQuery = graphql`
    {
        # Get links to by path to display in the navbar.
        platformNav: allSitePage(filter: { path: { glob: "/components/dropdown/*/" } }) {
            edges {
                node {
                    ...PlatformNavFragment
                }
            }
        }
    }
`;
