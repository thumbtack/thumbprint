This package houses all the SCSS, mixins, and functions for Thumbprint SCSS packages. It makes available two files:

1. `components.css` is the combined CSS of all SCSS packages.
2. `mixins.scss` is a rollup of all SCSS mixins and functions.

## Usage

The most common use case is including `mixins.scss` into your SCSS files. This gives you access to the responsive mixins and, less frequently needed, any of the mixins that power some SCSS packages, like `button` or `link`.

### Mixins & functions

```scss
@import '[node_modules path]/thumbprint-scss/mixins';
```

### Component CSS

```scss
@import '[node_modules path]/thumbprint-scss/components';
```

## Mixins

### Responsive mixins

Helpful SCSS mixins for using media queries and setting breakpoints. These mixins are commonly used alongside [variables from Thumbprint Tokens](/tokens/) but do support arbitrary pixel values.

#### `tp-respond-between`

```scss
// Include this `import` at the top of your file.
@import '@thumbtack/thumbprint-scss/mixins';

@include tp-respond-between($tp-breakpoint__small, $tp-breakpoint__medium) {
    // The CSS within this block will render between the specified breakpoints.
}
```

#### `tp-respond-above`

```scss
// Include this `import` at the top of your file.
@import '@thumbtack/thumbprint-scss/mixins';

@include tp-respond-above($tp-breakpoint__small) {
    // The CSS within this block will render above specified breakpoint.
}
```

#### `tp-respond-below`

```scss
// Include this `import` at the top of your file.
@import '@thumbtack/thumbprint-scss/mixins';

@include tp-respond-below($tp-breakpoint__large) {
    // The CSS within this block will render below the specified breakpoint.
}
```

### Preventing overlap

Media queries are inclusive, meaning that if you use the same breakpoint value for both `min-width` and `max-width`—for example, `700px`—the conditions will be true for both when the viewport is exactly `700px`. This can lead to undesired results.

```scss
@media (min-width: 700px) {
    color: red; /* Applies "color:red" at 700px and above */
}

@media (max-width: 700px) {
    color: blue; /* Applies "color:blue" at 700px and below*/
}
```

To prevent this our Sass mixin `tp-respond-above` adds `1` to the `min-width` media query so that it applies to `701px` and above while the `max-width` stays at `700px` and below. Now the code will output:

```scss
@media (min-width: 701px) {
    color: red; /* Applies "color:red" at 701px and above */
}

@media (max-width: 700px) {
    color: blue; /* Applies "color:blue" at 700px and below*/
}
```

## Functions

<DeprecatedComponentAlert>
    This package and <InlineCode>tp-spacer</InlineCode> were deprecated on September 11 in favor of
    margin and padding classes from <Link to="/atomic/">Thumbprint Atomic</Link> or tokens from{' '}
    <Link to="/tokens/#section-space">Thumbprint Tokens</Link>.
</DeprecatedComponentAlert>

### Usage

When using margin or padding vales in your Sass use the `tp-spacer(N)` function where N is an increment of `0.5`. Our base spacer unit is `8px`.

You should default to using the spacer function whenever possible but when building components that internally require small, precise spacing it is okay not to use the spacer function.

```scss
@import '@thumbtack/thumbprint-scss/mixins';

.my-component {
    margin-bottom: tp-spacer(2); // equivalent to 16px
    padding: 0 tp-spacer(2.5); // equivalent to 20px
}
```

### HTML Classes

For spacing classes to use in your HTML see [Thumbprint Atomic](/atomic/).

<ComponentFooter data={props.data} />

export const pageQuery = graphql`
    {
        # Get links to by path to display in the navbar.
        platformNav: allSitePage(filter: { path: { glob: "/components/global-scss/*/" } }) {
            edges {
                node {
                    ...PlatformNavFragment
                }
            }
        }
        # Get package information by NPM package name.
        packageTable: json(name: { eq: "@thumbtack/thumbprint-scss" }) {
            ...PackageTableFragment
        }
    }
`;
