description: Compact controls that allow for toggling and filtering

### Usage

Chips allow users to make selections, filter content, or trigger small actions. Chips should appear as a group of multiple elements in most cases. Unlike buttons, chips shouldnâ€™t navigate away from the current page. If the action requires a new page to load, please use a button instead of a chip.

### Components

There are two types of chip components: ToggleChip and FilterChip.

A toggle chip behaves the same way as a checkbox and should be used for a set of options where more than one option can be selected.

A filter chip behaves more like a button and should be used for filtering options.

### States

There are two global states: selected and unselected. Unselected states have a 2dp border while selected states have a solid color.

### Size

Only one chip size is available on native. It uses the Body3 bold font size (12sp).

### Implementation

The two android classes are called ThumbprintToggleChip and ThumbprintFilterChip for the toggle and filter chips respective. They both have the same three attributes.

-   `text` : String. The text to display inside the chip. Configurable either in xml or via properties.
-   `isSelected` : Boolean. Whether the chip is currently in the selected state (property) or what state it starts in (xml). The default is for the chip to start in the unselected state.
-   `onSelectedChangedListener` : (View, Boolean) -> Unit. A function to be called whenever the selected state of the chip changes.

export const pageQuery = graphql`
    {
        # Get links to by path to display in the navbar.
        platformNav: allSitePage(filter: { path: { glob: "/components/chip/*/" } }) {
            edges {
                node {
                    ...PlatformNavFragment
                }
            }
        }
    }
`;
