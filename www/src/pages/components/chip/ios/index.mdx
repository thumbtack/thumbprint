### Usage

Chips allow users to make selections, filter content, or trigger small actions. Chips should appear as a group of multiple elements in most cases. Unlike buttons, chips shouldnâ€™t navigate away from the current page. If the action requires a new page to load, please use a button instead of a chip.

### Components

There are two types of chip components: ToggleChip and FilterChip.

A toggle chip behaves the same way as a checkbox and should be used for a set of options where more than one option can be selected.

A filter chip is meant to behave more like a button and should be used for filtering options.

Both types of chips behave the same way to user interaction, they only differ visually and on intended use.

## Accessibility

Font size adjustability works the same as for the Pill component.

For visually impaired navigation the pill represents itself as a toggle button.

## Public API

### Chip

Superclass of both `ToggleChip` and `FilterChip`. The subclasses have no additional configuration options.

#### `public var text: String?`

While an optional, should always be set to a non-empty string before display.

#### `public var image: UIImage?`

If present will always show on the leading side. Should always be a tiny sized icon.

### FilterChip

Has no additional configuration options beyond its superclass `Chip`

### ToggleChip

Has no additional configuration options beyond its superclass `Chip`

export const pageQuery = graphql`
    {
        # Get links to by path to display in the navbar.
        platformNav: allSitePage(filter: { path: { glob: "/components/chip/*/" } }) {
            edges {
                node {
                    ...PlatformNavFragment
                }
            }
        }
