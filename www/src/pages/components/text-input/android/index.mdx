### Components

There are three types of Text Input components:

-   `ThumbprintTextInput` : A single line `ThumbprintEditText` with no drawables. While you can use `ThumbprintTextInputWithDrawables` without defining any drawables in place of this View, it is recommended to use this View if you do not plan on defining drawables. This is because `ThumbprintTextInputWithDrawables` has tap event listeners which will do unncessary work if no drawables are defined.
-   `ThumbprintTextInputWithDrawables` : A single line `ThumbprintEditText` with support for start and end drawables. Drawable click events can be handled by assigning a lambda expression to `drawableStartListener`, or `drawableEndListener`.
-   `ThumbprintClearableTextInput` : A single line `ThumbprintEditText` that allows for a custom drawableStart, but not a custom drawableEnd. Instead, the drawableEnd will be a X that can be tapped to clear the current input and focus the View.

All the above components inherit from `ThumbprintEditTextBase`, which iteslf inherits from `EditText`.

### States

The following states are available for inputs: Default, selected, filled, disabled, and error.

### Implementation

The following are the new attributes added on top of Andriod's default EditText:

-   `hasError` : Boolean. Indicates whether the Text Input is currently in an error state.
-   `isDisabled` : Boolean. Indicates whether the Text Input is currently in a disabled state.
-   `state` : Boolean. Returns the current state of the Text Input. Can not be set.
-   `focusOnDrawableTap` : Boolean. Indicates whether to listen for drawable click events.
-   `drawableStartListener`: () -> Unit. Callback for when `ThumbprintTextInputWithDrawables`'s drawableStart is clicked.
-   `drawableEndListener`: () -> Unit. Callback for when `ThumbprintTextInputWithDrawables`'s drawableEnd is clicked.
