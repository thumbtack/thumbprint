## Usage

Pills are badges that help to explain or draw attention to a certain area of the UI. Often used to qualify leads or label inbox elements. Pills can accomodate one small icon.

## Theme

There are seven standard pill themes on iOS. In addition, custom themes can be defined by calling the `Pill.Theme` constructor directly. The standard pill themes also use title7 for the title font.

## Accessibility

Set `adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory: true` to enable Dynamic Type support for a `Pill`. Pill titles will never wrap to more than one line, and resist increasing their text size beyond what will allow them to fit in the button. If circumstances still don't allow for the full pill title to display, the title will first take out up to all the width of the pill and if that still isn't enough it will truncate at the end.

For visually impaired navigation the pill is just represented by its title label.
