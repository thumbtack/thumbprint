## 📱 Native

Work on expanding Thumbprint to include designs, code, and guidelines for our native apps has started in earnest and we’ll make it a regular part of these updates. This quarter we’ll be designing a number of components and updating our infrastructure to better support our native teams.

-   Dan R. is working on inputs and control components.
-   Jon K. is designing modals and sheets.
-   Daniel O. is updating our [tokens](/tokens/scss/) infrastructure to support native.

## 🍭 Design

-   AJ is nearly done with our new illustration library. We'll be kicking off how it will be integrated into Thumbprint next week.
-   Tom G. is continuing research into prototyping with Principle and Framer X. Reach out to him if you have ideas or questions.
-   We added new guidelines for [truncation](/guide/product/truncation/) patterns.

## 💾 API

-   Daniel O. and Tom G. are nearly complete with a [responsive image](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y_KFYkorj6XAjot-mKPS0qnuY00bksif2a48vLaWluI/edit) component that will make them easier to use and improve performance.
-   Matt P. and Tom G. updated how our [Mark font](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint/blob/master/packages/thumbprint-font-face/_index.scss) is served to users and we’re now using a version with a smaller file weight.
-   Tom G. migrated the deprecated `tp-spacer` SCSS function to our [spacer tokens](/tokens/scss/#section-space).
