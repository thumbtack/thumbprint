Welcome to 2022, and welcome back to the Thumbprint newsletter!! There is a lot of incredible excitement coming into this year as an organization, and I’m equally excited to get this year kicked off with re-energizing the design systems effort at TT.

## Wins and #loveits

Celebrating the wins with distributing #loveits for the fantastic teammates willing to put in the time and effort to improve Thumbprint.

-   Big #loveit to Daniel O’Connor for dropping all his knowledge and helping the design systems get up to speed.
-   Thanks to all who pitched in to help test the new intake process for submitting design system requests (see ‘What’s new’ section below for more information) #loveit

## What’s new

It’s always exciting to get a new pair of shoes. While we won’t don these changes on our feet, these improvements to the product are even more exciting than those new sneakers!

-   There are two new additions to our icon family.
-   circle-map-pin-filledcircle-money-filled

View the new icons at [https://icons.thumbprint.design](https://icons.thumbprint.design/) or in [Figma Thumbprint Global](https://www.figma.com/file/YrpLNWoOwvEADbyFBWzuKv0V/?node-id=2%3A1) library.

## Updates and changes

We know Thumbprint is a great product, but there is always room for improvement, just like any home renovation project. Here are some updates and changes to the product that we’re excited to celebrate!

### 1. Breakpoint sizing in guidelines

The specific breakpoint values have not been added to the [Breakpoints Guidelines resouce](https://thumbprint.design/guide/product/breakpoints/). You can now find out exactly where the Small, Medium, and Large responsive breakpoints will be triggered. Documentation is even available from both the engineering and design perspective. We’ve even included a link directly to the Figma Breakpoint Cheatsheet.

### 2. Figma tooltips are now more responsive

Tooltip (dark and light) are now more flexible than ever. It’s now possible to resize the component horizontally, and the text will grow/shrink, respectively. In addition, you can also add line breaks, and the height will automatically adjust with your insertions. Keep in mind the max-width is still set to 235px wide so remember to keep that text concise!

## What’s coming up

The future is bright. On that note, here are some projects that are in the pipeline. If any of these projects coming up excite you and  you’re interested in contributing, please connect with the team in the [#design-systems](https://thumbtack.slack.com/archives/C7FLM0ZGU) channel in our Slack workspace.

### 1. Figma Auto Layout Updates

More components will be receiving attention on modernizing our design approach. This means migrating the current designs to leveraging the Auto Layout formatting in Figma.

### 2. Thumbprint Request Form

Are you looking to make a change to the design system? Looking for a new component, have a suggestion for a change to an existing component, reporting a bug, no problem. Work has begun on developing a framework for intake, triage, and execution for design systems product changes.

## **✨**Did you know?

Looking for a short snippet to help get you excited about design systems. Below you’ll find a brief knowledge drop that is noteworthy. It’s our “The more you know” (shooting star) moment.

**Thumbprint Global Figma Library is the most widely used design library in the design system.**

-   422 total components
-   259,798 component inserts from last year between the TT Design and TT Brand teams.
