## üì± Native

-   We had a kick-off meeting for a new `Avatar` component that will be built by Santi G. on iOS and Luke B. on Android.
-   The Android Button component is nearing completion. (Mallika P.)
-   Thumbprint Tokens was published to CocoaPods as a beta release (`pod 'ThumbprintTokens', '8.1.0-beta.4'`). Daniel O. is working with Kevin B. to release this in Thumbprint and implement it in the iOS codebase.

## üç≠ Design

-   Native designs for Layouts, Messenger Elements, Cards, Carousels, Bottom Navigation, and Headers will be published Friday (Jon K.)
-   Popover and the Date Picker for web have updated designs. (Jon K.)
-   Avatar (update), Title Frame, and Global Shadows (beta) are in the works for both Native and web. (Jon K.)

## üñ• Web

-   The [`Avatar` React component](https://thumbprint.design/components/avatar/react/) changes were released and rolled out in `website`. The changes include new options, a rename of the default export, and a nicer design for avatars without images. (Giles L.)
-   Images used in `Avatar` are now lazy-loaded with [our Image component](https://thumbprint.design/components/image/react/) rather than [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes). (Daniel O.)
-   `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` is now configured correctly. (Giles L.)
