## ðŸŽ‰ Thumbprint relaunch

Today we officially launched a newly redesigned [Thumbprint](https://thumbprint.design). Content has been reorganized and section links are always available from the trusty sidebar.

Special thanks to Jon K. for help with the redesign and QA.

## ðŸ’¾ Now open source

Thumbprint is now an officially open source project and our [repository](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint) is public. This brings with it some advantages:

-   Gives back to wider open source community that served as inspiration for us.
-   Encourage contributions to Thumbprint.
-   Provides prospective employees a view into our process and technology.

Huge credit goes to Dan C. for leading this effort, moving around a ton of code, and keep it on track.
