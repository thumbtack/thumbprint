## 🎉 Thumbprint public launch

Today we officially launched a newly redesigned [Thumbprint](https://thumbprint.design). Content has been reorganized and section links are always available from the trusty sidebar.

We also published an [introduction](https://medium.com/thumbtack-design/an-introduction-to-thumbprint-61f1dfde5c93) on our Thumbtack Design account on Medium. Feel free to share.

Special thanks to Jon K. for help with the redesign and QA.

## 💾 Now open source

Thumbprint is now an officially open source project and our [repository](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint) is public. This brings with it some advantages:

-   Gives back to wider open source community that served as inspiration for us.
-   Encourage contributions to Thumbprint.
-   Provides prospective employees a view into our process and technology.

Huge credit goes to Dan O. for leading this effort, moving around a ton of code, and keeping it all on track.
