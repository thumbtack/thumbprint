## üì± Native

-   Dan R. built a whole bunch of components for Thumbprint iOS. These components include `Dropdown`, `TextArea`, `TextInput`, `Radio`, and `Checkbox`.
-   Kevin B. continues to improve the accessibility of Thumbprint iOS components by adding support for Dynamic Type.
-   Mallika P. is building a `Button` component for Thumbprint Android.
-   Daniel O. created a [JIRA board for Thumbprint Native](https://thumbtack.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=280&projectKey=DS&selectedIssue=DS-731) and a [component overview page on thumbprint.design](https://thumbprint.design/components/overview/) that provides a high-level view of our progress.

## üç≠ Design

-   The Thumbtack illustration library, a cross-team effort between the Brand and Design System's team, is nearing completion. A rollout plan will be shared soon.
-   Tom G. is testing functionality and building prototypes using [Principle](https://principleformac.com/) and [Framer X](https://www.framer.com). If you have a project you'd like to prototype please let him know!

## üñ• Web

-   Daniel O. is wrapping up [work on the Thumbprint Image component](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint/pull/187). The component will make it easy to lazy-load responsive images. It will pair nicely with an `ImageServiceProvider` component he's building that will live in `website`.
-   Thanks to Kazu O. and Ken U. for contributing PRs to Thumbprint! Kazu added [new functionality to our DatePicker](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint/pull/223) and Ken [improved one of our documentation examples](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint/pull/215).
