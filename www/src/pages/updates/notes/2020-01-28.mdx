## 🍭 Design

-   Buttons and their related components were updated in Figma to remove manually control padding, saving designers time.
-   A new public, birds-eye view of Thumbprint is now available in Figma. This will be featured on Figma's [designsystems.com](https://designsystems.com) site.
-   Jon K. and Lucas S. are both presenting at Config, the Figma conference in SF on Feb 6th.

## ✉️ Email

-   We held the Thumbprint for Emails kickoff meeting on Jan 28th to start the Design phase of this effort. Jon K. will be working with a cross-functional design team to deliver email assets in Figma.
-   On the developer side we’ll be creating, documenting, and maintaining the components needed to build the emails.
