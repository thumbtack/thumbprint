-   We held the Thumbprint for Emails kickoff meeting today to start the Design phase of this effort. Jon K. will be leading the audit of our existing emails and delivering email assets in Figma.
-   On the developer side we’ll be creating, documenting, and maintaining the components needed to build the emails.
