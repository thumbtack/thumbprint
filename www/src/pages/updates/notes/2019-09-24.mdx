## 📝 Survey says...

At the end of Q3, the Design Systems team sent out the sixth iteration of the “Building UIs at Thumbtack” survey. With our primary focus on supporting the native apps the results were in line with our expectations.

-   **Net Promoter Score**: Our NPS dropped slightly on web but went up considerably on both up on iOS and Android. Web is still first, followed by iOS then Android.
-   **Productivity**: iOS engineers are most confident that recent changes to Thumbprint have made them more productive. Android came in second but saw the largest improvement over Q2. Web came in last and recorded the lowest score in the six iterations of this survey.
-   **Confidence in future**: Web, iOS, and Android all scored over 4.0 (of 5.0). All of the comments were positive.

-   Box shadow [tokens](https://thumbprint.design/tokens/scss/#section-shadow) and [Atomic classes](https://thumbprint.design/atomic/#section-box-shadow) have been added.
-   Our Image component now supports `forceEarlyRender` prop that disables lazy loading and hardcodes the `sizes` value. This can be helpful for above-the-fold images on server-side rendered pages.
