-   Box shadow [tokens](https://thumbprint.design/tokens/scss/#section-shadow) and [Atomic classes](https://thumbprint.design/atomic/#section-box-shadow) have been added.
-   Our Image component now supports `forceEarlyRender` prop that disables lazy loading and hardcodes the `sizes` value. This can be helpful for above-the-fold images on server-side rendered pages.
