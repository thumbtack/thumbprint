-   Bianca G. has [added a new theme](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint/issues/89) to the `Button` and `ThemedLink` components. She wrote [Thumbprint's first codemod](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint/tree/master/packages/thumbprint-codemods) and handled the breaking change migration in `website`.
-   Giles L. is rolling out [size changes to our Avatar component](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint/issues/25).
-   Tom G. is simplifying the DOM that the the `Image` component outputs, making it easier to understand and maintain.
-   Daniel O. has refactored our `ServiceCardImage` component to use [Thumbprint's Image component](https://thumbprint.design/components/image/react/) instead of [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes).
-   Giles L. has fixed a bug and inconsistencies in our `Input` and `Textarea` error states.
-   Jichan [added a vertical alignment props](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint/pull/270) to our `Checkbox` and `Radio` components.
-   Giles L. has added linting to Thumbprint to help us catch usage of functions that don't work in IE 11.
-   Ken U. has implemented and rolled out visual [improvements to our DatePicker component](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint/pull/250).
-   Giles L. has added a slight open delay to our Tooltip component, preventing users from accidentally opening tooltips while using Thumbtack.
-   Giles L. has [created a `ModalDefaultContentFullBleed` component](https://thumbprint.design/components/modal-default/react/#example-full-bleed-modal) that allows sections of a modal to extend past the built-in padding.
