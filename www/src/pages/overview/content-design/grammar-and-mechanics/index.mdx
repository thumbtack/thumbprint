## Write using plain language

Writing in a way people understand helps them accomplish their goals with ease. We help both pros and customers find what they need and learn how to use that information by making content easy to understand.

### Use conversational language

Our content should sound approachable and never robotic. Copy that sounds human is easier to read and reduces cognitive load.

Check out our Voice and Tone section to learn more about how we talk.

### Active vs. passive voice

#### **Use active voice by default**

The subject of a sentence performs the action when writing in active voice. Using active voice makes our products sound more conversational.

<Grid gutter="wide">
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="do" coloredHeading>
            <div className="black-300">
                Don’t want to request the review directly? Let us email them for you.
            </div>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="dont" coloredHeading>
            <div className="black-300">
                Don’t want to request the review directly? An email can be sent on your behalf.
            </div>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
</Grid>

### **Use passive voice to emphasize the action**

You can opt for passive voice when you want to emphasize the action instead of the subject of a sentence. This can be helpful when you want to:

-   Avoid blaming the user or system
-   Avoid referring to Thumbtack

<Grid gutter="wide">
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="do" coloredHeading>
            <div className="black-300">Unable to save prices</div>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="dont" coloredHeading>
            <div className="black-300">We can’t save your prices</div>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
</Grid>

### First vs. third person

Choosing the best pronoun for a given scenario helps us write copy that’s conversational and more inviting.

### **Use first person when talking about Thumbtack**

<Grid gutter="wide">
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="do" coloredHeading>
            <div className="black-300">It feels good to get things done. We’re here to help.</div>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="dont" coloredHeading>
            <div className="black-300">
                It feels good to get things done. Thumbtack is here to help.
            </div>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
</Grid>

### **Use third person sparingly when talking about Thumbtack**

We typically only use third person when speaking about pros, customers, or products as separate entities.

<Grid gutter="wide">
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="do" coloredHeading>
            <div className="black-300">
                We analyzed millions of bids from Thumbtack pros to see what things really cost.
            </div>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="dont" coloredHeading>
            <div className="black-300">
                Thumbtack analyzed millions of bids from Thumbtack pros to see what things really
                cost.
            </div>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
</Grid>

See Accessible and Inclusive Language for more information on writing using plain language.

## Formatting

The way we format and organize information helps people understand the information on their screen. This allows people to quickly find what they need and complete important tasks.

### Header tags

Using the right header tags helps people scan the information on their screens quickly so they can move forward with their tasks. Here are some best practices for using header tags:

-   Use H1 tags to communicate the title of the page
-   Use only one H1 per page
-   Use H2 tags for second-level headings
-   Use H3 tags for third-level headings sparingly
-   Don’t skip heading levels

<Grid gutter="wide">
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="do" coloredHeading>
            <Title size={1}>Header 1</Title>
            <Title size={2}>Header 2</Title>
            <Title size={2}>Header 2</Title>
            <Title size={3}>Header 3</Title>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="dont" coloredHeading>
            <Title size={1}>Header 1</Title>
            <Title size={3}>Header 3</Title>
            <Title size={2}>Header 2</Title>
            <Title size={1}>Header 1</Title>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
</Grid>

### Bolded and italicized text

### **Avoid using bold or italicized text to emphasize a point**

To help people scan the content on a page, frontload the important information instead of bolding or italicizing it.

<Grid gutter="wide">
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="do" coloredHeading>
            Get $100 in credits for telling us which tools you use to manage your availability
            outside of Thumbtack.
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="dont" coloredHeading>
            <div className="mb3">
                Tell us which tools you use to manage your availability outside of Thumbtack and{' '}
                <span className="b">get $100 in credits</span>.{' '}
            </div>
            <div>
                Tell us which tools you use to manage your availability outside of Thumbtack and{' '}
                <i>get $100 in credits</i>.
            </div>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
</Grid>

### Underlined text

### **Don’t underline text to emphasize a point**

We should only underline text when it links to other content.

<Grid gutter="wide">
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="do" coloredHeading>
            Get $100 in credits for telling us which tools you use to manage your availability
            outside of Thumbtack.
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="dont" coloredHeading>
            <span className="underline">Get $100 in credits</span> for telling us which tools you
            use to manage your availability outside of Thumbtack.
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
</Grid>

See Accessible and Inclusive Language for more information on formatting content.

### Capitalization

### **Use sentence casing**

We use sentence casing for most user-facing content, including:

-   Headlines, headers, and subheads
-   Body copy
-   Buttons and links
-   Form field titles and hint text
-   Job categories
-   Most product names\*
-   See title casing section for exceptions to this guideline.

### **Use title casing for specific product names only**

We only use title casing for specific product names:

-   Help Center
-   Top Pro
-   Thumbtack Support
-   Get Hired Guide
-   Project Guide
-   Service Guide

Check out our word list to learn more about how we use these terms across our products.

## Punctuation

### Use contractions with care

Contractions make our products sound more conversational, but should be used with care depending on the situation so we don’t sound awkward.

### **Use positive contractions**

In general, positive contractions are easier to understand and also create a more conversational tone.

### **Avoid negative contractions**

Negative contractions are difficult to read and may be easily misread.

<Grid gutter="wide">
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="do" coloredHeading>
            <ul>
                <li>I'll</li>
                <li>I'm</li>
                <li>It's</li>
                <li>There's</li>
                <li>They're</li>
                <li>We'll</li>
                <li>We're</li>
            </ul>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
    <GridColumn aboveSmall={6}>
        <DoDont type="dont" coloredHeading>
            <ul>
                <li>Can't</li>
                <li>Couldn't</li>
                <li>Didn't</li>
                <li>Don't</li>
                <li>Shouldn't</li>
                <li>Weren't</li>
                <li>Won't</li>
                <li>Wouldn't</li>
            </ul>
        </DoDont>
    </GridColumn>
</Grid>

### **Avoid conditional contractions**

These types of contractions create additional cognitive load for users with cognitive impairments and lower reading comprehension. Avoid using contractions like:

-   Could’ve
-   Should’ve
-   Would’ve

See Accessible and Inclusive Language for more information about contractions.

### Comma usage

### **Use the Oxford comma**

The Oxford or serial comma should be used to break up a series of three or more elements in a sentence.

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| Your base price includes consultation, travel fees, and mount on drywall, plaster, or wood | Your base price includes consultation, travel fees and mount on drywall, plaster or wood |

### **Avoid using commas to combine multiple sentences**

To improve readability, try breaking up complex sentences into two or more sentences.

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| This is a 60% discount off the current price of instant bookings. We'll let you know in advance before prices change. | This is a 60% discount off the current price of instant bookings, and we'll let you know in advance before prices change. |

### **Use a comma to separate parts of an address or place name**

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| We’ll arrive at 415 Natoma St., San Francisco, California, on August 5th. | We’ll arrive at 415 Natoma St., San Francisco, California on August 5th. |

### Dashes

### **Em dashes**

Em dashes can be used to:

-   Show a break in a sentence
-   Separate a noun or series of nouns from the rest of the sentence
-   Show an open range, such as a date with no end date
-   Emphasize a point

### **Use an em dash with a space before and after**

Adding a space both before and after the em dash allows for cleaner line breaks.

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| Next, you’ll choose a budget – a max amount you’re able to spend weekly on leads. | Next, you’ll choose a budget–a max amount you’re able to spend weekly on leads.Next, you’ll choose a budget -- a max amount you’re able to spend weekly on leads. |

### **Hyphens**

### **Use hyphens to connect 2+ words that should be understood together**

### **Don’t hyphenate the word “very” and most words that end in -ly**

| Do  | Don’t |
| --- | ----- |
| do  | don't |

### **Use hyphens in prefixes**

| Do       | Don’t           |
| -------- | --------------- |
| Auto-pay | AutopayAuto pay |

### Exclamation marks (!)

### **Use exclamation marks sparingly**

It’s easy to overuse exclamation marks, so only use them when you need to add emphasis that won’t overwhelm people. You can add an exclamation mark to celebrate with customers and pros, but don’t overdo it.

| Do                            | Don’t            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 🎉 New direct lead! Howard G. | Set your budget! |

See our Voice and Tone guidance for more information on when to use exclamation marks.

### Headers

(insert guidance - 1. Add period, or 2. Note we’re removing periods)

| Do  | Don’t |
| --- | ----- |
| do  | don't |

### **Emails**

Avoid using periods in email subject lines.

| Do                                   | Don’t                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Required: Review your business hours | Required: Review your business hours. |

See Surfaces and Elements for more information about writing email copy.

### **Navigation**

Avoid using periods in links, buttons, and tabs.

| Column 1                          | Column 2                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Do                                | Don’t                                |
| OpportunitiesCalendarView details | Opportunities.Calendar.View details. |

### Ampersands (&)

### **Avoid using ampersands**

Only use an ampersand if you have a hard character limit.

### **Don’t use ampersands after commas**

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| Your base price includes consultation, travel fees, and mount on drywall, plaster, or wood | Your base price includes consultation, travel fees, & mount on drywall, plaster, or wood |

### Lists

### **Use a colon to introduce items in a list**

### **Don’t separate items in the list with commas**

This does not apply to using commas within a list item.

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| Instant Book offers better returns for the money you spend on Thumbtack through:Higher-intent customersReduced competitionLess time communicating with customers | Instant Book offers better returns for the money you spend on Thumbtack through:higher-intent customers,reduced competition, andless time communicating with customers. |

## Numbers and dates

### Numbers

-   Use ###-###-#### formatting when writing telephone numbers. Don’t use parentheses.
-   Spell out small numbers in a sentence
-   Use the actual number only if it’s in a form field, chart, date or other UX value
-   Use the number for 100 and up.
-   For very large numbers, combine the number and word (32 million). Abbreviate (\$32M) only if you have a hard character limit.
-   Use the % sign for percentages..

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| 555-867-5309<tbd - example for spelling out number after final decision><tbd - example for spelling out number after final decision><tbd - example for spelling out number after final decision>32 million24% | (555) 867-5309 or 1-867-5309<tbd - example for spelling out number after final decision><tbd - example for spelling out number after final decision><tbd - example for spelling out number after final decision>32,000,00024 percent |

### Dates and times

-   Spell out dates whenever possible.
-   Use shorthand only if you have a hard character limit.
-   For times, use lower case “am” or “pm” with no space before.
-   Eliminate the :00 when the time is on the hour.
-   Use “to” rather than a dash. (8am to 12:15pm.)

| Do | Don’t |
| --- | --- |
| July 16, 20238am<tbd - example for :00 after final decision>8am to 12:15pm | 7/16/23 (unless there’s a character limit)8 a.m. or 8 am<tbd - example for :00 after final decision>8am – 12:15pm |
