## What guides us

We look to our brand attributes of **refreshing**, **realistic** and **reliable** when crafting tone and voice across our product.

We’ve also crafted a set of **content design standards** that guide us when we’re building Thumbtack from the inside out.

Read on for our standards on inclusive language, tone volume, and surface-specific guidelines.

## Tone Volume

**What’s the difference between voice and tone?**

**Voice** doesn’t change: It’s how you sound, always and forever.

**Tone** changes all the time: It’s how you speak, depending on who you’re talking to or the situation you’re addressing.

For content design, we **change our tone** depending on the setting and the context.

**Different moments, different tones**

When deciding on tone volume, we consider things like:

-   Stage of user journey
-   The user’s current emotions
-   The amount of space for copy

**When do we (usually) use what tone?**

| Low tone | Medium tone | High tone |

**Low tone v. high tone**

_Rationale (low tone): Stressful moment for user + serious subject matter + in the middle of customer action_

_Rationale (high tone): Top of funnel, user isn’t in the middle of a task, lighter subject matter_
