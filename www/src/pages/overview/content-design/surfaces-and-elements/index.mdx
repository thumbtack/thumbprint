## Emails

Keep emails short, ideally less than 150 words. To emphasize a point, use a single sentence paragraph. Otherwise, each paragraph should cover one topic in no more than four lines (about 50 words). Lean on subheaders and bulleted lists to structure complex information.

### Subject lines

Keep subject lines under 10 words and don’t punctuate them. They should communicate the most important information, like a deadline or required action.

### Pre-headers

This is the sentence that appears next to or near the subject line in an email inbox. It’s often clipped, so keep it under 10 words. Write it as a complete sentence with punctuation that reinforces the subject line, continues the conversation, or entices action.

### Headers

Not all emails need headers, but they can be a helpful way to highlight and frontload the main message of an email. Headers often repeat or expand upon the subject line. Ideally, headers are contained to one line.

### CTAs

Always include at least one call to action, even if it’s just to go to the app. To test for readability, ask if the main message of the email can be understand by reading the subject line, header, and CTA alone.

### Footers

Always include the standard footer with our business address, a link to unsubscribe, and links to download the app.

## Push notifications

Push notifications are an effective way to communicate time-sensitive, actionable messages — especially to pros who are on the job. Assume you’re writing for a smaller phone screen with a standard font display setting.

### Headers

Fit headers on one line and use them to communicate the main message. Emojis that are associated with specific features (like the lightning bolt for Instant Book) can help communicate context in fewer characters.

### Body

Body copy should be no more than three lines. Make sure that it indicates where the user will navigate if they follow (tap/swipe) the push notification.

## Calls to action

Buttons and links should always be sentence case.

-   Buttons and links should always be sentence case, unless they contain a proper noun.
-   Buttons should never contain any punctuation. Links can contain punctuation if needed for clarity.
-   Keep buttons to 4 words absolute maximum (usually 3 or less).
-   Keep links to 8 words absolute maximum (usually 6 or less).

## Error messages

-   Error messages come in 3 forms: body copy; header and body; or header, body and CTA.
-   Keep headers to 10 words or less, and don’t wrap to a 2nd line.
-   Body copy should fit on 2 lines total and be no more than two sentences. Use complete sentences.
-   Always include a path forward for what to do next, even if it’s just to try again later.
-   Avoid generic language like “there was an error”
-   Take responsibility if it’s our fault (“we weren’t able to process your payment” vs. “the payment failed”).
-   Emphasize how we’re making it right over apologies. (“We’re working to improve” goes further than “We’re sorry.”)
-   Follow our standard CTA guidelines when creating error CTAs.
