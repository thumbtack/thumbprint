## Why content design matters

## What guides us

We look to our brand attributes of **refreshing**, **realistic** and **reliable** when crafting tone and voice across our product.

We 've also crafted a set of **content design standards** that guide us when we 're building Thumbtack from the inside out.

Read on for our standards on inclusive language, tone volume, and surface-specific guidelines.

## Inclusive language

We design our content to be inclusive. ere are some of the things we consider along the way.

### We ask ourselves:

-   Would this make sense to someone who didn 't work here?
-   Can someone easily scan and understand what 's important?
-   If someone can 't see the colors or images, is the message still clear?
-   Does the content avoid ableist or gendered language, or language with racial bias?

### We 're mindful of:

-   **Avoiding directional language.** Revise content that requires users to see the layout of the page, e.g. _Select from the options in the sidebar._

-   **Employing a hierarchy.** lways put the most important information first.

-   **Jargon and slang.** Prioritize clarity over cleverness.

-   **Visual elements.** Ensure that important information is supported by copy alongside the visuals.

### We watch for:

-   **Racial bias**
    -   Describe race with specificity when possible (use Black pros vs. pros of color)No language with roots in racism (link)
-   **Gender bias**
    -   No gendered descriptors (e.g. ladylike)No gendered occupational language (e.g. waitress instead of server)
-   **Thematic bias**
    -   No language that might be considered offensive or perpetuate a harmful stereotype for a particular group
-   **Ableist language**
    -   No language that implies the person as a whole is disabled (use pro with disabilities vs. disabled pro)

## General guidelines

### Use 1st person when talking about us.

> It feels good to get things done. **_We 're_** _here to help._

> When you need to hire a landscaper, a plumber, an electrician - **_we 'll_** _find you one, for free._

### Use 3rd person sparingly.

We typically only use 3rd when speaking about pros, customers or products as separate entities:

> We _analyzed millions of bids from_
>
> **_Thumbtack_** _pros to see what things really cost._

### Sentence casing

We use sentence casing for most user-facing content, like:

-   Headlines, headers, subheads
-   Body copy
-   Buttons and links
-   Form field titles and hint text
-   Job categories
-   Most product names (exceptions on next slide)

### Title casing

We only use title casing for specific product names:

-   Help Center
-   Top Pro
-   Thumbtack Support
-   Get Hired Guide
-   Project Guide
-   Service Guide

### Punctuation

-   We 're all about contractions.
-   Use Oxford commas when listing a series.
-   Use em dashes with spaces on both ends.
-   Substitute an em with an en dash when attributing a quote.
-   Use exclamation points sparingly.
-   Avoid ampersands and any abbreviations, unless you have a hard character limit.

### Punctuation for headers, emails, navigation

-   Use end punctuation in headers and subheads.
-   End most headers with a period.
-   Don 't use end punctuation in navigation (links, buttons, tabs).
-   Don 't use end punctuation in email subject lines, but use it everywhere else in an email.

### Numbers

-   Format phone numbers as, 123-456-7890. Don 't use ( ).
-   Spell out any small number in a sentence.
-   Use the actual number only if it 's in a form field, chart, date or other UX value.
-   Use the number for 100 and up.
-   For very large numbers, combine the number and word (32 million). Abbreviate (\$32M) only if you have a hard character limit.

### Emojis

-   Think gemstone, not glitter (that gets on our hands, in our house...no fun.)
-   Email subject lines or pre-headers (never both), push notifications, or sparingly in product.
-   Emojis punctuate an idea at the end of sentence or set the tone by beginning a string of copy ‚Äî not in üî• the middle.
-   For inclusivity, avoid emojis with skin color.

### Dates and times

-   Spell out dates (July 16, 2021) whenever possible. Use shorthand (7/16/21) only if you have a hard character limit.
-   When used in a sentence, add the -th /-st (_See you July 16th_).
-   Use the % sign for percentages (24%).
-   For times, use lower case ‚Äúam‚Äù or ‚Äúpm,‚Äù no space before. Eliminate the :00 when the time is on the hour. Use ‚Äúto‚Äù rather than a dash. (_8am to 12:15pm._)

## **Surface-specific guidelines**

### Emails

-   Keep emails to about 150 words or less.
-   Start a new paragraph after 50 words or so for scannability.
-   Include at least one call to action (link or button), even if it 's just to go to the app, or a learn more link.
-   Keep email subject lines to 10 words or less. Same with headers.
-   Include standard footer with business address, unsubscribe, app download buttons.

### Email pre-headers

-   The pre-header is the sentence that appears next to or near the subject line. It can be any length, but should be a single, full sentence.
-   Assume that all words after the first 10 might not be visible. Make the sentence clear without the additional words.

Example: _Fix any issues with your direct deposit details to get your \$500 in prepaid job earnings_ may cut off at or before the word _get_.

Consider revising to _To get your \$500 in prepaid job earnings, fix any‚Ä¶_

Pre-headers shouldn 't contain critical info not already supplied in the email subject, header and body. They can be written as:

-   Reinforcement of the subject line (without literally repeating it).
-   Continuation of an idea in the subject line, as a conversation.
-   A summary of the main message of the email.
-   A value prop connected to the email 's CTA, to encourage/entice action on the part of the user.

### Push notifications

-   Fit push headers on one line, and body copy on no more than three, within iOS and Android preset guides. Assume a smaller model of phone screen with a standard font display setting.
-   The header should attract attention, while also giving a strong sense of what 's happening.
-   Make sure it 's clear where the user will navigate if they follow (tap/swipe) the push notification.

### Calls to action

-   Buttons and links should always be sentence case, unless they contain a proper noun.
-   Buttons should never contain any punctuation. Links can contain punctuation if needed for clarity.
-   Keep buttons to 4 words absolute maximum (usually 3 or less).
-   Keep links to 8 words absolute maximum (usually 6 or less).

### Error messages

-   Error messages come in 3 forms: body copy; header and body; or header, body and CTA.
-   Keep headers to 10 words or less, and don 't wrap to a 2nd line.
-   Body copy should fit on 2 lines total and be no more than two sentences. Use complete sentences.
-   Always include a path forward for what to do next, even if it 's just to try again later.
-   Avoid generic language like ‚Äúthere was an error‚Äù
-   Take responsibility if it 's our fault (‚Äúwe weren 't able to process your payment‚Äù vs. ‚Äúthe payment failed‚Äù).
-   Emphasize how we 're making it right over apologies. (‚ÄúWe 're working to improve‚Äù goes further than ‚ÄúWe 're sorry.‚Äù)
-   Follow our standard CTA guidelines when creating error CTAs.

### Forms and form fields

-   Copy for radio buttons and checkbox options should be short - 10 words or less per item.
-   Full sentences should be used sparingly, and only when there are a small number of options, as with a simple survey question.
-   Labels for form fields should be 5 words or less in a short phrase (‚ÄúLast name;‚Äù ‚ÄúYear your business was founded‚Äù).
-   Helper text (inside of form fields) is optional, and should only be used when clarification is needed.

### FAQs

-   Use sentence case on all questions.
-   Base questions on real user data (i.e., what customers are really asking about).
-   The first sentence should directly answer the question - don 't go on tangents.
-   Limit answers to 100 words or less. If you need more space to explain, split into a second question.
