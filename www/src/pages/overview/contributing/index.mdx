A design system only works when there’s input from a wider team. We encourage contributions both big and small from designers and developers.

## Ways to contribute

### 1. Suggest a design change or bug fix

See something that needs a tweak or uncover a bug in one of our components? Let us know and we will determine how best to get your concern addressed. You can also [file an issue](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint/issues/new) in the Thumbprint GitHub repository.

### 2. Propose guidelines or components

Each quarter we tackle new [Toolkits](/guide/product/toolkits/), but we welcome suggestions for new or existing ones. Capturing existing use cases while allowing for future flexibility is always a challenge and we want to know if we’ve missed the mark.

### 3. Volunteer to work on a Toolkit

If you have a particular area of interest and would like to work on the design or development of a Toolkit reach out to us. We’ll help you determine how to get started and the steps to completion.

## Developers

In our GitHub repository we maintain a [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file that contains developer-specific instructions for contributing code to Thumbprint.
