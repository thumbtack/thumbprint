<Alert type="note" title="HTML headings">
    Though numbered 1 though 8, our <InlineCode>Title</InlineCode> components are independent of the
    HTML heading elements
    <InlineCode>h1</InlineCode>-<InlineCode>h6</InlineCode>. Use the <InlineCode>size</InlineCode> required
    by the design with the appropriate
    <InlineCode>headlingLevel</InlineCode> prop for SEO and semantics.
