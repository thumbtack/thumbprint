# Thumbprint Atomic

This package contains a library of atomic classes used for building layouts. It was based primarily on [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) with some syntax changes.

This output of this package is a compiled CSS file. It can be included into a larger SCSS file or used as a standalone CSS file and should be the last file included.

Full documentation including usage examples is available on the [Thumbprint](https://thumbprint.design/atomic/usage/) website.
