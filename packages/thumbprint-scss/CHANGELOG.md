## 1.0.0 - 2019-04-08

### Changed

-   [Patch] Replace `$tp-spacer__unit` in `textarea.scss` with hardcoded pixel value.

### Removed

-   [Major] Remove `function.scss` that contained the `tp-spacer` function which used a unit of `8` to output a pixel value. To upgrade, first replace any instances of `tp-spacer(*)` that have an equivalent [space token](https://thumbprint.design/tokens/scss/#section-space). Then replace any remaining instances with a hardcoded pixel value. For example, `tp-spacer(1)` would be `$tp-space__2`, `tp-spacer(1.5)` would be `12px` as it has no equivalent space token.

### Added

-   [Minor] Add `tertiary` theme that is the same as our `secondary` style. `secondary` will soon be redesigned to have blue text. Consumers should replace `tp-button--secondary` with `tp-button--tertiary` to avoid and visual changes. (#89)
