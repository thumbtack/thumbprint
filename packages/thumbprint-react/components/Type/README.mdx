## Title

These type styles uses [variables from Thumbprint Tokens](/tokens/#section-type). You can refer to that documentation for font-size, line-height, and font-weight values.

```jsx
<Title size={1}>
    28px (mobile) / 40px is the title size and can run as long as it needs to to fill up the space.
</Title>
```

```jsx
<Title size={2}>
    24px (mobile) / 32px is the title size and can run as long as it needs to to fill up the space.
</Title>
```

```jsx
<Title size={3}>
    22px (mobile) / 24px is the title size and can run as long as it needs to to fill up the space.
</Title>
```

```jsx
<Title size={4}>
    20px is the title size and can run as long as it needs to to fill up the space.
</Title>
```

```jsx
<Title size={5}>
    18px is the title size and can run as long as it needs to to fill up the space.
</Title>
```

```jsx
<Title size={6}>
    16px is the title size and can run as long as it needs to to fill up the space.
</Title>
```

```jsx
<Title size={7}>
    14px is the title size and can run as long as it needs to to fill up the space.
</Title>
```

```jsx
<Title size={8}>
    12px is the title size and can run as long as it needs to to fill up the space.
</Title>
```

## Text

```jsx
<Text size={1}>
    16px is the text size that forms sentences and can run as long as it needs to to fill up the
    space. It should still look good.
</Text>
```

```jsx
<Text size={2}>
    14px is the text size that forms sentences and can run as long as it needs to to fill up the
    space. It should still look good.
</Text>
```

```jsx
<Text size={3}>
    12px is the text size that forms sentences and can run as long as it needs to to fill up the
    space. It should still look good.
</Text>
```

## With custom classes

You can use the `className` prop to add _additional styles_ to "Title" and "Text" components. It's not possible to override the styles defined by this component. This includes `font-weight` in `Title` as well as `font-size` and `line-height` in `Title` and `Text`.

If you need more flexibility, we recommend either using the ["Type" tokens in Thumbprint Tokens](/tokens/#section-type) or working with a designer to use one of the styles on this page.

```jsx
<Text size={1} className="underline tr">
    This text is underlined and right aligned
</Text>
```
